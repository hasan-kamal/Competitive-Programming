# About

This directory contains my solutions to programming problems from the [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=3) book by [Steven Halim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/) and Felix Halim. 

This directory's hierarchy is roughly a 1:1 mapping with chapters and sections of the book. For eg, if problem #`00xyz` is listed in Chapter A, Section B of the book, then its solution is located in `cp3_book/chA_<chapter-name>/sectionB_<section-name>/<optional-subdir>/uva_00xyz`. Here, `<optional-subdir>` may be used to group similar problems together according to the problem type mentioned in the book.

Number of problems solved: 46
